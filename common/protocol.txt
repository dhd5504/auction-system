Text protocol v0 (client/server demo)
-------------------------------------
- Each request is a single ASCII line ending with '\n'.
- Commands use spaces for LOGIN and '|' as a delimiter for REGISTER fields.

Requests
- LOGIN <email> <password>
- REGISTER <fullName>|<email>|<password>|<phone>
- PING

Responses
- OK <optional message>
- ERROR <reason>

Notes
- Client code sanitizes line breaks and '|' before sending.
- UI never touches QTcpSocket directly; network/TcpClient wraps the socket and emits signals back to UI.
